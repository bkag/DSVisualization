# Data Visualization - Why do we care?

Need combination of 3 skill sets. Coool Venn Diagram available here.

- Math and statistics skills
- Computer Science/ IT
- Domain/ Business Knowledge

<!-- Olaf Menzer's github repo for this talk: -->

Data Visualization is for:
- augmenting human capabilities to view and interpret data
- understand relationships between factors
- recognize patterns
- break down complexity/ dimensionality reduction
- exploratory analysis
- communicating results to consumers

Example: Anscombe's quartet

Each of these has the same stats. Visualization helps us tellthe whole story.

## What makes a good graph successful?

- Domain situation : you misunderstand their needs
- Data/task abstraction: you show them the correct thing
- Visual encoding/interaction idiom: justify design with respect to alternatives
- Algorithm: analyze computational complexity, etc
- Analyze results qualitatively

## In Practice, Data scientists are faced with:

- Too many coices in graph types and platforms
- Searching for a template that is most suitable for the data
- Having to test if the graph represents information accurately.
- Finally, developing a narrative/story

# Data Visualization: Elements and Tools

## Data Representation and Abstraction ("What?")

Data and dataset types:

- Tables
- Networks and Trees
- Fields
- Geometry
- Clusters, Sets, Lists

## Visualization Actions ("Why?")

- Search (Lookup, Locate, Browse, Explore)
- Query (Identify, Compare, Summarize)
- Analyze (Consume: Discover, Present, Enjoy.  Produce: Annotate, Record, Derive)

### Most Widely Used Tools ("How?")

- Histograms
- Bar Charts
- Bubble Plots
- Waterfall Charts
- Radar Plots
- Line Chart
- Area Plot
- Box Plots
