# Data Visualization - Why do we care?

Need combination of 3 skill sets. Coool Venn Diagram available here.

- Math and statistics skills
- Computer Science/ IT
- Domain/ Business Knowledge

<!-- Olaf Menzer's github repo for this talk: -->

Data Visualization is for:
- augmenting human capabilities to view and interpret data
- understand relationships between factors
- recognize patterns
- break down complexity/ dimensionality reduction
- exploratory analysis
- communicating results to consumers

Example: Anscombe's quartet

Each of these has the same stats. Visualization helps us tellthe whole story.

## What makes a good graph successful?

- Domain situation : you misunderstand their needs
- Data/task abstraction: you show them the correct thing
- Visual encoding/interaction idiom: justify design with respect to alternatives
- Algorithm: analyze computational complexity, etc
- Analyze results qualitatively

## In Practice, Data scientists are faced with:

- Too many coices in graph types and platforms
- Searching for a template that is most suitable for the data
- Having to test if the graph represents information accurately.
- Finally, developing a narrative/story

# Data Visualization: Elements and Tools

## Data Representation and Abstraction ("What?")

Data and dataset types:

- Tables
- Networks and Trees
- Fields
- Geometry
- Clusters, Sets, Lists

## Visualization Actions ("Why?")

- Search (Lookup, Locate, Browse, Explore)
- Query (Identify, Compare, Summarize)
- Analyze (Consume: Discover, Present, Enjoy.  Produce: Annotate, Record, Derive)

### Most Widely Used Tools ("How?")

- Histograms
- Bar Charts
- Bubble Plots
- Waterfall Charts
- Radar Plots
- Line Chart
- Area Plot
- Box Plots
- Time Series Plots

Visual Design Aspects (~Tufte)

- Show the data
- Present many numbers in a small space
- Make large data sets coherent
- Encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data
- Reveal the data at several levels of detail
- serve a clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration
- Be closely integrated with statistical and verbal description of a data set

Other Considerations:

- Who is the intended audience?
- What is your target medium? Laptop, projector, printed, etc?

# Emerging Data Visualization

- "Tomorrow's Earth"(_Science_ June 28th 2018)
- 10 million data points in one large networkgraph example

# How to test if your graph represents your data correctly?

1. Plot multiple samples of the same data set
1. Plot various aggregation levels ( sum, group by, mean vs. median)
1. Plot even more samples
1. Validate with externaldata sets (ideally obtained from independent sources)
1. Use interactivity
1. Test for visual significance, e.g. with error bars
1. Transform axis (log, log-log, sigmoid, etc), align, stretch/compress axis ranges
